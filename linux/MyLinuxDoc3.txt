1. Installation-remove packages

1.1 Installation
-Update the apt package index:
	$ sudo apt-get update
-In case of installation and upgrading through REPOSITORIES, install packages
to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
	$ sudo apt-get install \
	apt-transport-https \
    	ca-certificates \
    	curl \
    	gnupg-agent \
    	software-properties-common
-Install the packages pk1 and pk2:
	$ sudo apt-get install pk1 pk2 --allow-unauthenticated
	
	Explanation:
	-the option --allow-unauthenticated is used to tell apt to accept
unsigned packages. This option is to use only when you trusted the unsigned
packages.  

1.2 Fingerprint checking
-If you need to check the fingerprint of an image key, do this:
	$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

	Explanation:
	This tells apt to search for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint.
You can tell compare the fetched display key with the key you need to verify.

1.3 Set up a repository for installation and upgrade through repositories
-Enter this command:
	$ sudo add-apt-repository \
   	"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   	$(lsb_release -cs) \
   	stable"
	
	Explanation:
	-The second through last line is about the repository to set up (it's
the package 'docker' in this example). You need to follow the package
documentation to know what to put.

	
1.4 Removing packages
-Enter this command:
	$ sudo apt-get remove pk1 pk2

	Explanation:
	-Tells apt to remove pk1 and pk2

2. Users-Groups management
2.1 List members of a group in Linux using /etc/group file
-Enter the command:
	$ grep 'group_name' /etc/group

	example result: group_name:x:4:user1,user2
	Explanation:
		-x is the group's password (not displayed)
		-4 is the groupid GID
		-user1, user2 are the members in the group.

2.2 Add user to a group
-Enter the command:
	$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
	
	Explanation:
	-add the login user to the group 'docker'
	-log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.
	-if testing on a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.
	-On Linux, you can also run the following command to activate the changes to groups:
		$ newgrp docker 

3. System configuration
3.1 Configure applications to start on boot
Most current Linux distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu 16.04 and higher) use systemd to manage which services start when the system boots. Ubuntu 14.10 and below use upstart.

Using systemd:

	$ sudo systemctl enable appname 

To disable this behavior, use disable instead.

	$ sudo systemctl disable appname


4. Systems commands
4.1 Tasks management
	-command + & => execute task in background mode
	-stop a foreground process : CTRL-C
	-suspending Processes : CTRL-Z
	-jobs: see all stopped or backgrounded processes
	-ps T: list processes with their state
	-fg %jobnumber : resume execution of that task 
	-bg %jobnumber : resume execution of that task in background
	-kill %jobnumber: kill the background process with that jobnumber
