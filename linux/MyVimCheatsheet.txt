Getting help:
                      ** Use the on-line help system **

  Vim has a comprehensive on-line help system.  To get started, try one of
  these three:
        - press the <HELP> key (if you have one)
        - press the <F1> key (if you have one)
        - type   :help <ENTER>

  Read the text in the help window to find out how the help works.
  Type  CTRL-W CTRL-W   to jump from one window to another.
  Type    :q <ENTER>    to close the help window.

  You can find help on just about any subject, by giving an argument to the
  ":help" command.  Try these (don't forget pressing <ENTER>):

        :help w
        :help c_CTRL-D
        :help insert-index
        :help user-manual


Miscellanous:
  -execute an external command: must be in the extended command mode (:): !
  -extracting a part of the text and save it in another file: 
    -select the text with v and cursor (see selection)
    -then save it with :w filename
  -retrieving and merging file:
    -place the cursor at the merging position
    -type :r FILENAME (:r means read)
  -merging with an output of an external command: 
    -place the cursor at the merging position
    -type :r !EXTERNALCOMMAND
